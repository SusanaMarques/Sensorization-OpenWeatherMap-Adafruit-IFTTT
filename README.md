# Sensorization OpenWeatherMap Adafruit IFTTT

### Monitoring of environmental parameters: temperature, humidity and ultraviolet index | **Visit the created site [here](https://www.weathersense.susanavitoria.pt/)**

### Concepts and frameworks learned with this project:

- Sensorization
- Weather API
- Notifications
- OpenWeatherMap
- Adafruit
- IFTTT
---
Through the OpenWeatherMap API and the OneCall API, information was collected on temperature, humidity and UV index, per hour for the next 12 hours on any desired city.

### Use of Adafruit: 
Treatment of data collected through the creation of several feeds in the Adafruit service, these connected with the API OpenWeatherMap through JavaScript.

### Use of IFTTT:
Connection of values received from Adafruit with IFTTT and with an email created to receive notifications.
Creation of triggers that correspond to sending a notification to weathersenseiata@gmail.com whenever a trigger is triggered.
